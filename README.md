# Testing Gatsby graphQL on airtable vs pure react with axios (HTTP request) on airtable

I just wanted to know how Gatsby and graphQL capability will be able to perform when connected to Airtable to:

1. Get data from Airtable and render in your browser;
2. Filter the data using graphQL;
3. Change the data structure using graphQL;

More importantly, this experiment pretends to understand the difference in performance between Gatsby & graphQL when compared to react & axios as well as get a better sense for the code required to implement both solutions
